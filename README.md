## Living

I'm living in Dortmund, [Ruhrgebiet], Germany after having been some years in
Shanghai, China.

## What I Like

- Reading books

## Professional Work

I'm working as a process manager for embedded software development processes and
a solution architect at the [Automotive] division of [KOSTAL] .

## Software Development

I enjoy developing software, both at my job and as a hobby. Some embedded
software (C, C++), some applications and tools (mainly Python nowadays). Also
getting involved in DevOps related topics (containers, Docker), monitoring
(Prometheus, Grafana) and IT automation (Ansible).
